# CS499 Capstone - Computer Science

### Self-Assessment 
My name is May Carson, and I am finishing my degree program from Southern New Hampshire University to receive my degree in August 2025. My journey through the past few years has challenged me academically and personally. I have gained comprehensive knowledge on a wide array of topics, including why it is important to have strong code. I have also developed an understanding of design principles, databases, algorithms, and software languages. I chose the Contact Management System for the CS320 course.

This portfolio was created to highlight my newfound knowledge and act as my canvas to showcase a collage of my abilities and attention to detail. This repository paints the path of my work on this project and gives insight into my decisions and challenges while completing it. It also shows how I would be able to problem-solve in a professional setting due to the complex nature of this project. 

This portfolio shows a plan to enhance a project that failed to even compile at first, and how I was able to make it run the necessary tests. It shows the skills I developed while achieving my enhancements and revising past capabilities. I navigated through different areas of software engineering like testing algorithms, securing databases, and implementing best practices for design.

This collection of artifacts is a testament to my progress and competence in coding. They serve to illustrate my versatility and comprehension in my field. This project was chosen specifically because it aligned with course requirements, and I was able to enhance it because of meticulous research and testing. It shows I can learn and grow within the field and gives me a glimpse of the road that lies ahead of me as I step into my role within the Air Force as a data analyst. 

### Software Design
This code was created around October 2025, as the first project in the course CS320. This course highlights software testing and data input. The ContactService.java was created to store contact information. I chose this artifact to show my understanding of handling data and show how I can design and implement code that meets the needs of requirements, like the ability to edit contact information or delete it. I want to show I understand how classes perform and interact. I implemented best practices by adding code comments to my code to show updates and add of userâ€™s email.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
This artifact is from the same project. My artifact is an ArrayList, which is a part of CRUD operations, the data structure that creates the system storage. I wanted a way for my contacts to be validated and handled while maintaining structure and managing any duplicate data. It displays my ability to implement an algorithm to handle errors and load information from a database. I implemented a capacity limit to minimize duplicate data and prevent errors.

### Databases
This artifact is from the same project. I chose the ContactService.java because it is the chosen database for this project, and I believe it demonstrates my aptitude to code a program that can sort data quickly and efficiently. This project specifically highlights my ability to code a program when tests are run. I want to enhance my error handling to ensure that the database can connect properly and validate my data.
